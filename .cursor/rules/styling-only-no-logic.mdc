# Styling-Only Requests: Do Not Change Logic

When the user requests **styling**, **UI**, **CSS**, or **visual/layout** changes only (e.g. spacing, dividers, colors, fonts, pill buttons, header appearance):

- **DO** change only: stylesheets (`*.css`), JSX/TSX layout and className usage, and presentational markup.
- **DO NOT** change: application logic, API calls, prompts, system instructions, schema, data fetching, chatbot answer content or comprehensiveness, service layer (`anthropicService`, etc.), or any logic that affects what answers or data the user sees.

If the user says "only", "just", "styling", "CSS", "spacing", "visual", "UI", or similar, treat the request as styling-only unless they explicitly ask for logic or behavior changes. Reverting or refactoring should not remove or alter logic that affects answer quality or comprehensiveness.
