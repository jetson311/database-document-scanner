Trustee Baskin thinks it was the Organizational meeting and improperly scheduled. Attorney Buettner stated it is her legal opinion that there was nothing illegal about that meeting. Trustee Raymond countered that another attorney could have a different opinion. Trustee VanDeinse-Perez stated that as a Trustee it is irresponsible to continue to assert the Village has violated the law; our counsel has said over and over we have not violated the law. Trustees Raymond and Baskin continued to disagree. Trustee Baskin accused Mayor Rossi of doing this to accommodate his own schedule. Mayor Rossi stated it is infuriating for it to be insinuated that he schedules to accommodate his personal schedule and that he doesn't do his job. The Mayor noted that the Village always comes first and chastised Trustee Baskin for impugning the Village and for taking it to Facebook and the press. Mayor Rossi stated it is an ethical violation for the Trustees to say the meeting was illegal and noted he would appreciate a retraction and an apology.",
