  "meeting_summary": "Special meeting to announce executive liaisons and conduct annual appointments. Meeting became contentious when Trustees Raymond and Baskin attempted to table all appointment votes until organizational meeting on January 6. After heated exchange during which Trustee Raymond raised his voice, Mayor called recess and both Raymond and Baskin exited. Remaining board members proceeded to approve all clerk appointments, staff appointments, and board/committee/commission appointments. Rules of Procedure amended and 2025 organizational meeting location changed.",
